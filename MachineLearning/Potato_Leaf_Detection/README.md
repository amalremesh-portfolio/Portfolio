## 📋 Project Overview

In this project, I developed a CNN model to classify between healthy and diseased potato leaves. The workflow included:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
   - Cleaned and resized images  
   - Normalized pixel values  
   - Augmented dataset to avoid overfitting  

2. Model Building  
   - Built a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers  
   - Added dropout layers to improve generalization  

3. Training & Evaluation  
   - Trained the model using training and validation splits  
   - Plotted training vs validation accuracy & loss  
   - Evaluated on test set using confusion matrix  

4. Results  
   - Achieved *X%* accuracy (mention actual number if you know)  
   - Generated a confusion matrix to analyze class-wise performance
