# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Jupyter Notebook  
Skills: Image preprocessing, augmentation, CNN training, model evaluation

## 🔍 Description
I built a CNN model to classify healthy vs diseased potato leaves.  
The process included:
- Image preprocessing (resize, normalize)
- Data augmentation to reduce overfitting
- Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network
- Evaluating performance using accuracy/loss plots and confusion matrix

## 📁 Files Included
- potato_project.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with full code  
- report.pdf — project documentation  
- (Optional) sample dataset/ images if included

## 📊 Results
The model achieved good accuracy and shows clear performance trends in the included graphs.
